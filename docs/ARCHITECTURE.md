# System Architecture

## Overview

Distributed microservices architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

Client -> API Gateway -> Microservices -> Databases

## Microservices Structure

1. **API Gateway** - Single entry point, request routing, rate limiting
2. **Auth Service** - JWT-based authentication, role management
3. **User Service** - User profiles, preferences, management
4. **Business Service** - Business registration, verification, management
5. **Service Catalog** - Service definitions, pricing, availability
6. **Booking Service** - Appointment management, scheduling
7. **Payment Service** - Payment processing, refunds
8. **Notification Service** - Email, SMS, push notifications
9. **Review Service** - Ratings, reviews, feedback

## Data Flow

1. User requests -> API Gateway
2. Authentication validation -> Auth Service
3. Business logic -> respective microservice
4. Data persistence -> PostgreSQL
5. Cache -> Redis for frequent queries
6. Async tasks -> RabbitMQ for background processing

## Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal scaling of stateless services
- Database read replicas for heavy read operations
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Load balancing at API gateway level
